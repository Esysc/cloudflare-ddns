  # Use a local pylint hook that runs the pylint executable from your active
  # Python environment (system or virtualenv). This avoids pre-commit needing
  # to fetch and checkout a remote mirrors-pylint tag which can fail in some
  # environments. If you later want pre-commit to manage pylint, run
  # `pre-commit autoupdate --repo https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-pylint`
  # locally and update this config with the pinned rev it produces.

  # ShellCheck pre-commit hook (koalaman). Pin to a branch or tag you prefer.
  # Pin the koalaman shellcheck pre-commit hook to a concrete tag. If this
  # rev doesn't exist for you, run `pre-commit autoupdate --repo https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck-precommit`
  # locally to find a valid immutable tag and commit the updated rev.

  # NOTE: shellcheck hook removed because mirrors for shellcheck can sometimes
  # be unavailable in some environments; please install `shellcheck` locally
  # (brew install shellcheck) and run `shellcheck` in CI if desired.

  # NOTE: pylint and mypy were removed from this default config to avoid
  # heavy environment setup in `pre-commit` on initial install. If you want
  # stricter static checks enable them and pin correct `rev` values, e.g.
  # mirrors-pylint at a valid pylint release.
